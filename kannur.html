        <p class="text-justify">Idukki district is one among the 14 districts of Kerala state, India. The district headquarters is located at Kuyilimala in Painavu. The name of the district is derived from the malayalam word Idukki, meaning narrow gauge. 

    Idukki has an area of 5,105.22 km2 (1,971.1 sq mi) and is the second largest District of Kerala. About 97 percent of the total area of the District is covered by rugged mountains and forests. There is only a strip of Middle land (3%) in the western part of the district. Low land area is totally absent in the district. More than 50% of the area of the district is covered by forest. Anamudi, the highest peak in India south of Himalayas, is in the Kuttampuzha Panchayat of Adimali Block, in the K.D.H Village of Devikulam taluk. 13 other peaks in the district exceed a height of 2,000 m (6,562 ft). The Periyar, Thodupuzhayar and Thalayar are the important rivers of the district. Kundala Dam, Mattupetty Dam, Munnar head works, ponmudi dam and the kallarkutty Dam are constructed across the various tributaries of Periyar. There are a few natural lakes in the district. They are Eravikulam and Devikulam lakes in Devikulam taluk, Elavizhapunchira, in Thodupuzha taluk. Two types of the soil are found in the district. The highland area is covered by forest soil(Alluvial soil) and the other parts by laterite soil. 

    Due to the Large scale of Migration to the District from other parts of Kerala and from the Neighboring Tamilnadu, Idukki is having a mixed culture. 

    A landlocked district, Idukki is one of the most nature rich areas of Kerala. High ranges and wooded valleys are girded by three main rivers - Periyar, Thalayar and Thodupuzhayar - and their tributaries. The River Pamba also has its origin here. As a tourist destination, Idukki offers diverse attractions like Wildlife sanctuaries, Hill stations, Dams, Spice plantation tours, Mountain treks, Elephant rides etc. 

    Idukki is a hilly district having many unique topographical and geographical characteristics.
