                The Snake Park at Parassinikkadavu is around 16 km drive from Kannur. The park is not as detailed as the one in Chennai but is worth a quick stop between your visit to Rajarajeshwara Temple and Sri Muthappan Temple. It has a fair collection of venomous snakes such as king cobra, spectacled cobra and common krait, a variety of vipers as well as non-venomous snakes such as rat snake, green whip snake and checkered keelback snake, and crocodiles. The park is also home to many birds, including Brahmin kite, peacock, crane, barn owl and fish owl as well as animals such as porcupine, monkey and Indian fox. There is an interactive show where the trained staff interacts with snakes and quells myths about snakes. 
                The feeding of the king cobra during the live session seems to be the crowd favourite.
