        <h2 class="text-lg-center">KOTTAYAM</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Kottayam is one of fourteen districts in the state of Kerala, India. 
            Kottayam district comprises six municipal towns: Kottayam, Changanassery, Pala, Erattupetta, Ettumanoor, and Vaikom. 
            It is the only district in Kerala that neither border the Arabian Sea nor any other states.
            Alapra is the only village in Kottayam district where the traditional art of Padayani is performed. Hindustan Newsprint Limited and Rubber Board are two central government organizations located in the district. 
            The headquarters of two religious communities in Kerala are also in the Kottayam District: Nair Service Society and the Indian Orthodox Church.
            The name Kottayam is a combination of the words "kotta" and "akam" in the local language of Malayalam, meaning "interior of a fort".
            The current Kottayam district was previously part of the state of Travancore. Earlier, the Travancore state consisted of two revenue divisions: the southern and northern divisions, 
            both under the administrative control of a "Diwan Peshkar" for each. Later in 1868, two more divisions—Kollam and Kottayam—were constituted. A fifth division Devikulam was added, but it only lasted for a short period, and was then joined with Kottayam. At the time of the integration of the state of Travancore and Kochi in 1949, these revenue divisions were renamed as districts and the Diwan Peshkars gave way to district collectors, paving the way for the birth of the Kottayam district in July 1949. 
            The cities included were Kottayam, Muvattupuzha (including present-day Kothamangalam), Thodupuzha, Changanasserry, Vaikkom, Meenachil, Devikulam and Peermade taluks.
            Visit Kottayam in Kerala, an ancient town located on the hilltop touching the western ghats on the east. 
            On the other hand, the place is bordered by Vembanad Lake on the west. A place like Kottayam that is culturally rich and naturally precious should definitely be in everyone’s bucket list. 
            The town also holds a record of 100% literacy rate in India.Kottayam has a network of rivers, backwaters, ancient religious places, and hill stations.
            The town is also fondly termed as ‘Akshara Nagari’ which means ‘City of letters’. Also, Kottayam is famous for its spices, crops and, most importantly, rubber. While travelling through the town, you will spot a plethora of rubber and spice plantations throughout your way. With ancient, intricate shrines and graceful landscapes, the place is an all-in-one destination.

                Amidst the backwaters of Vembanad Lake rests a tiny island called Pathiramanal which acts as a favourite spot for the millions of birds that have come from abroad. Pathiramanal is a Malayalam word that means the sand if midnight. An hour long motor drive from the shores of the Vembanad Lake will take tourists to Pathiramanal and the beauty one might experience on this journey can leave a long lasting impression on their memories. The 28, 505 hectares of the island is home to more than 50 migratory birds and 100 avian species. Lush greenery and vicious scenery of the island lure tourists to visit here and it also serves as an ideal stopover from a backwater tour in Kumarakom.

                Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary is one of the most popular bird sighting spots in the country. This 14-acre bird sanctuary was earlier a tree plantation, is located on the eastern banks of the Vembanad Lake. Alfred George Baker laid the base of Kumarakom village and also the bird sanctuary by recovering 500 acres of wetlands from the Vembanad lake in the year 1840. Then the descendent of Baker, Henry developed this bird sanctuary and built it more attractive to draw the attention of domestic as well as international tourists. The bird sanctuary was popular by the name of Baker's Estate earlier.
