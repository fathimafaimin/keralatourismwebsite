        <h2 class="text-lg-center">KASARAGOD</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
         Kasaragod is the northernmost district of Kerala and is also known as Saptha Bhasha Sangama Bhoomi (The land of seven languages) as seven languages namely, Malayalam, Tulu, Kannada, Marathi, Konkani, Beary, and Urdu are spoken, unlike the other districts of Kerala.
        The district is situated on the rich biodiversity of Western Ghats. 
        It was a part of the Kannur district of Kerala until 24 May 1984.
         The district is bounded by Dakshina Kannada district to the north, Western Ghats to the northeast, Kodagu district to the southeast, Kannur district to the south, and Arabian Sea to the west. 
        Kasaragod district has the maximum number of rivers in Kerala, 12
        Kasaragod town is located on the estuary where the Chandragiri River, which is also the longest river in the district, empties into Arabian Sea. 
        Kasaragod is home to several forts which include Arikady fort, Bekal Fort, Chandragiri Fort, and Hosdurg Fort (Puthiyakotta Fort). 
        Bekal Fort is also the largest fort in Kerala. The historic hill of Ezhimala is located on the southern portion of Kavvayi Backwaters of Nileshwaram. 
        Talakaveri, which is home to Talakaveri Wildlife Sanctuary where the 805 km long Kaveri River originates, is located closer to Ranipuram in Kerala-Karnataka border.
        Kasargod town is known by the name Kanhirakode (meaning, 'The land of Kanhira Trees') in Malayalam, Kanhira/Kanjira is Malayalam word for Kasaraka trees (Kannada name) found in abundance here. 
        Kanhirakode is the Malayalam version of Kasaragod.
        Tulunad, where Tulu is traditionally spoken, is said to be bound on the south by the Chandragiri river and fort, thus including Kasaragod city within the Tulunad region.
        Though linguistically the Tulu country extends to the south only upto the Chandragiri river at present, culturally the region between the Chandragiri and the Kavai (Kavvayi) rivers has remained as a twilight zone between the Malayalam and the Tulu countries.

                Bekal Fort was built by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi in 1650 AD, at Bekal. 
                It is the largest fort in Kerala, spreading over 40 acres (160,000 m2).
                The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. 
                Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.
                Incidentally, it is believed that Bekal is derived from the word Baliakulam, meaning a big palace. 
                Ruled by the most powerful feudal kingdoms in the past, it was an important maritime centre back then. Presently, this town attracts hundreds of tourists and is a great spot to start the exploration of the stunning Malabar Coast.
